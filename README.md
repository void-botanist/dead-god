# Dead God
# A Binding of Isaac: Rebirth visualization project

Dead God started as a data visualization class project fueled by my love of Rebirth.  It examines the trends in Steam achivements for Rebirth and its DLCs.  I'm expanding it slowly in my spare time to include more visualizations and analysis.  

## To Do
### General
* Update the CSS for smaller screens.
* Add alt text to images.
* Populate Sources page with font, image, and data info.
* Add footer with link back to repository.

### Charts
* Update all charts to Vega-Lite. This project was originally built with Chart.JS and Vega-Lite, but Vega-Lite is more flexible.
* Investigate adding auto-update functionality to refresh achivement values with Steam API pulls.
* Improve interactivity and readability of Rarity Distribution by DLC.
* Add tree diagrams to show what achievements build on each other.
* Add parallel set diagrams for different types of achievements by requirement and unlock, similar to https://cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/.
